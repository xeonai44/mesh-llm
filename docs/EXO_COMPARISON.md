# Mesh LLM and Exo

Use this comparison to understand how Mesh LLM and
[Exo](https://github.com/exo-explore/exo) differ across architecture, runtime,
networking, API compatibility, hardware support, and packaging models.

Both projects pool resources across machines to run models larger than a single
device can handle, but they diverge significantly in architecture, hardware
focus, and operational model.

## Summary

- **Exo** connects local devices into an AI cluster with automatic discovery,
  MLX/MLX-distributed backends, an event-sourcing architecture with Master/Worker/Runner
  systems, RDMA over Thunderbolt 5, and multiple API compatibility layers.
  Strongest on Apple Silicon where MLX and Thunderbolt RDMA provide a cohesive stack.
- **Mesh LLM** pools machines into private or published inference meshes with
  embedded Skippy/llama.cpp staged execution, QUIC/iroh peer-to-peer networking,
  gossip-based state dissemination, and package-backed GGUF layer splits for large models.
  Spans CUDA, ROCm, Vulkan, Metal, and CPU with one backend-neutral host paired
  with a selected, versioned native runtime.

Exo is a strong fit for local multi-device Apple Silicon clusters, especially
with Thunderbolt 5 RDMA and tensor parallelism. Mesh LLM is a strong fit for
operator-controlled distributed serving across heterogeneous hardware, private
and public mesh workflows, agent integrations, and large GGUF models that use
package-backed layer splits.

## Architecture

### Exo: Event sourcing with Master ordering

Exo uses an **event-sourcing architecture** with Erlang-style message passing
through a custom channel library. Five systems communicate over five topic
channels:

**Systems:**
- **Master** - single writer that executes placement, orders events, and
  maintains the DiskEventLog for crash recovery
- **Worker** - schedules work on a node, gathers system information
- **Runner** - executes inference jobs in an isolated process for fault tolerance
- **API** - Python web server with adapter pattern for multiple API formats
- **Election** - distributed master election for unstable networking conditions

**Topics:**
- **Commands** - API and Worker instruct the Master (placement, catchup)
- **Local Events** - all nodes write events; Master reads and orders them
- **Global Events** - Master writes ordered events; all nodes fold into `State`
- **Election Messages** - nodes negotiate master before cluster establishment
- **Connection Messages** - mDNS-discovered hardware connections

Events are past-tense side-effect records. Commands are imperative instructions.
The `apply()` function is a pure state-transition function. Nodes use
`OrderedBuffer` and NACK recovery to reconstruct identical state replicas.

**Key design principles** from Exo's RULES.md: referential transparency,
no hidden state, exhaustive type discipline with Pydantic, and eliminating
runtime error-handling overhead through type-level guarantees.

### Mesh LLM: Decentralized mesh with gossip

Mesh LLM uses a **decentralized mesh** with no single master or event log.
Nodes discover each other through:
- **Nostr discovery** for published/public meshes
- **Invite tokens** for private meshes
- **QUIC/iroh** for peer-to-peer transport

State is disseminated through **gossip protocol**: heartbeats carry peer state
updates, capability advertisements (vision, audio, multimodal, reasoning,
tool_use, moe), and mesh membership information. Each node independently
maintains its view of the mesh.

The **owner-control plane** uses an additive `mesh-llm-control/1` lane with
explicit endpoint bootstrap, separate from the public mesh plane for
mixed-version compatibility.

For model serving:
- A single-machine-fit model runs locally
- The mesh automatically routes requests by the `model` field to the peer serving it
- Skippy stage splits coordinate layer-range serving across multiple peers

### Key architectural differences

| Aspect | Exo | Mesh LLM |
|---|---|---|
| Coordination | Master as single writer | Decentralized, no single point |
| State model | Event-sourced, globally ordered | Gossip-based, eventually consistent |
| Fault tolerance | Master re-election, DiskEventLog replay | Mesh auto-heals through peer membership |
| Process model | Runner in isolated process | Embedded runtime in single process |
| API layer | Adapter pattern per API format | Unified openai-frontend crate |
| Type discipline | Python/Pydantic with strict types | Rust type system |

## Model splitting

### Exo

Exo supports three sharding strategies:

1. **Pipeline parallelism** - layers split sequentially across nodes
2. **Tensor parallelism** - weights partitioned within layers using all-reduce
   collectives; requires `supports_tensor=True` in model card and
   `hidden_size` divisible by node count
3. **CFG parallelism** - for image models, runs positive/negative prompt branches
   in parallel

Placement is computed through a **placement engine** that:
1. Identifies all cycles (paths) in the device topology graph
2. Filters by available memory vs model `storage_size`
3. Scores candidates with `_cycle_download_score` favoring cached models
4. Selects the smallest cycle to minimize communication overhead

Communication backends:
- **MLX Ring** - TCP/IP ring topology for standard networking
- **MLX Jaccl** - RDMA/Thunderbolt for high-performance connections

### Mesh LLM

Mesh LLM uses **Skippy stage splits**: contiguous layer ranges where each
range is a package-backed GGUF stage artifact.

The topology planner:
1. Inspects model architecture and available GPUs/memory across the mesh
2. Assigns contiguous layer ranges to each peer
3. Starts downstream stages first (last layer range first)
4. Waits for stage readiness
5. Publishes the stage-0 route for inference traffic

Stage artifacts live in **layer package repositories** with:
- `model-package.json` manifest
- GGUF fragments (one per stage range)
- Validation and certification metadata
- HF Jobs publishing workflow for automated building

### Splitting philosophy difference

Exo splits **within layers** (tensor parallelism) or between layer groups
(pipeline parallelism). The tensor approach requires all-reduce collectives
between every device on every layer step, which benefits from RDMA bandwidth.

Mesh LLM splits only **between layer groups** (contiguous ranges), avoiding
inter-device communication during inference. Each device decodes independently
once it receives its activation frame from the prior stage. This trades higher
per-device memory for zero inter-device communication during decode.
