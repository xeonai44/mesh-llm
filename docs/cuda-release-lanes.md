# CUDA release lanes

mesh-llm publishes **two CUDA release bundles per tagged release**. They
share source, features, and upstream llama.cpp pin, and differ only in
the CUDA toolkit version and GPU architecture coverage. Pick the one
that matches your NVIDIA driver.

## Why two lanes

nvcc from the **CUDA 12.8** toolkit emits cubins whose minor-version
metadata the **R535-series driver** (native CUDA 12.2) rejects at kernel
load time. This manifests as `CUDA error: device kernel image is
invalid` on the first matmul when running against sm_80 (A30/A100), even
though sm_80 cubins are physically present in the binary
(`cuobjdump --list-elf` confirms). Rebuilding the identical source tree
on the **CUDA 12.6.3** toolkit produces a working bundle on the same
hardware/driver.

At the same time, Blackwell compute capabilities (sm_100 B100/B200,
sm_120 RTX 50-series) were **first introduced in CUDA 12.8**; nvcc 12.6
cannot emit them at all. (sm_103 is a related Blackwell variant, but
nvcc 12.8.0 does not know it — that arch landed in a later CUDA
release; it's therefore omitted from our 12.8-toolkit Blackwell lane.)

There is no single toolkit that satisfies both audiences, so the release
workflow builds both.

## Lane summary

| Asset suffix | Toolkit | Arch coverage | Driver requirement |
|---|---|---|---|
| `-cuda` (primary) | CUDA 12.9.2 | sm_61, sm_75, sm_80, sm_86, sm_87, sm_89, sm_90 (Pascal → Hopper) | R535+ (CUDA 12.2 native) |
| `-cuda-blackwell` | CUDA 12.8 | sm_75..sm_90 plus sm_100, sm_120 (adds Blackwell) | R550+ (CUDA 12.4 native) |

- **Primary `-cuda`** covers the currently-deployed A30/A100/Ada/Hopper
  fleet on the stable R535 driver series. This is the recommended
  default.
- **`-cuda-blackwell`** is required only if you have Blackwell hardware
  (B100, B200, Thor, RTX 50-series). It will NOT load on R535 drivers
  even on older sm_80 hardware because the R535 driver rejects any
  12.8-minor-tagged cubin.

## How to pick one

- On any R535-series driver (default for Ampere-era HGX and most
  non-freshly-imaged datacenter hosts): use `-cuda`.
- On R550+ drivers running Blackwell hardware: use `-cuda-blackwell`.
- On R550+ drivers running only pre-Blackwell hardware (A30/A100/L40/
  H100 etc.): either bundle will work; prefer `-cuda` to avoid pulling
  in arch cubins you will not execute.

Check your driver:

```bash
nvidia-smi --query-gpu=driver_version --format=csv,noheader
```

## Asset naming

The outer archive filename distinguishes the lanes:

- `mesh-llm-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-cuda.tar.gz`
- `mesh-llm-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-cuda-blackwell.tar.gz`

Both archives contain byte-identical backend-neutral `mesh-llm` host bytes.
The outer archive filename distinguishes the CUDA lane, and the selected
`native-runtimes/<runtime-id>` directory contains that lane's ABI and CUDA
libraries. Use `mesh-llm update --flavor`
when you want to choose a specific update bundle:

- `mesh-llm update --flavor cuda` for the primary CUDA lane
- `mesh-llm update --flavor cuda-blackwell` for the Blackwell lane

## Installer behavior

`install.sh` exposes both as flavor strings and uses the same selection
order as `mesh-llm update`:

```text
cuda-blackwell on detected Blackwell NVIDIA hardware, otherwise cuda,
then rocm, vulkan, metal, and cpu fallback where those release targets exist.
```

```bash
# primary CUDA on pre-Blackwell NVIDIA hosts
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mesh-LLM/mesh-llm/main/install.sh | bash

# explicit Blackwell, or automatic on detected Blackwell NVIDIA hosts
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mesh-LLM/mesh-llm/main/install.sh \
  | MESH_LLM_INSTALL_FLAVOR=cuda-blackwell bash
```

The auto-detection path checks `nvidia-smi --query-gpu=compute_cap`
first and falls back to `/proc/driver/nvidia/gpus/*/information` model
names when `nvidia-smi` cannot report compute capability.

`mesh-llm update --detect-flavor` uses the same detection path when you
want an existing install to move to the best currently detected release
bundle.

## Building locally

Both lanes remain exposed from the root `Justfile`; their definitions are
loaded from its flat imports under `just/`:

```bash
# primary (CUDA 12.6.3 toolkit required on the host / container)
just release-build-cuda
just release-bundle-cuda "$VERSION"

# Blackwell (CUDA 12.8 toolkit required on the host / container)
# The Linux CUDA recipes select toolkit-dependent architectures internally.
just release-build-cuda
just release-bundle-cuda "$VERSION"
```

The Linux CUDA recipe selects its architecture list from the toolkit detected
on the host; it does not accept a positional architecture override.

## CI wiring

- `.github/workflows/release.yml` defines two sibling jobs:
  `build_linux_cuda` (12.6.3 container) and `build_linux_cuda_blackwell`
  (12.8 container). Both upload to the same GitHub release via the
  `publish` job's `needs:` list.
- The default toolkit versions are configurable at the repo level via
  Actions variables `vars.CUDA_VERSION` (primary, default `12.6.3`) and
  `vars.CUDA_BLACKWELL_VERSION` (Blackwell, default `12.8.0`).
## History

The split was introduced in [PR #355](https://github.com/Mesh-LLM/mesh-llm/pull/355)
after a reproducible A30 crash on R535 drivers was traced to the nvcc
12.8 / R535 cubin incompatibility. See issue
[#304](https://github.com/Mesh-LLM/mesh-llm/issues/304) for the
investigation, A/B build matrix, and 29-GPU test results.
