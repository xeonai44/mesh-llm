# Design: mesh-wide serving for plugin-hosted models

## Status

Implemented in this branch. A live end-to-end test covered a single node
running an external-relay plugin and serving an LM Studio model through that
node's own local proxy; it did not exercise an inbound mesh tunnel from
another peer or mesh-wide discovery and routing (see "Deliberately deferred"
below). That test surfaced a gap in how
a plugin-only node — one with zero local (downloaded) models, whose only
inference capacity comes from a plugin endpoint (e.g.
`inference: [openai_http(...)]`) — is treated by the rest of the mesh.

## What already worked

Two things were already correct by the time this investigation started,
and are not touched by this change:

- **This node's own local ingress.** The unified API proxy every node now
  binds unconditionally at startup (`run_auto()` → `api_proxy` →
  `network/openai/ingress.rs`) already merges `plugin_manager
  .inference_models()` into `/v1/models` and already has full
  external-endpoint forwarding for plugin-hosted models. This has been
  true since before this investigation — an earlier draft of this
  document (and an earlier commit on this branch, since dropped) mistook
  a *different*, no-longer-primary code path
  (`network/openai/transport.rs::handle_mesh_request`, reached only via
  the now-`#[expect(dead_code)]` "passive listener" lane —
  `run_auto_model_path_or_shutdown` — that a large "daemon model
  lifecycle reconciliation" refactor superseded between this fork's base
  and current `main`) for the node's primary listener. It isn't; that
  patch was reverted as a no-op once the actual current architecture was
  understood. See "History" below.
- **Gossip advertisement.** `mesh/gossip.rs`'s
  `plugin_inference_models()` already correctly merges plugin-provided
  models into what this node tells the mesh it serves.

## The actual gap

Even with both of those correct, no *other* peer could ever route a
request to a plugin-only node, for two structural reasons — both
independent of the local-ingress/gossip machinery above, and both still
present on current `main`:

### 1. Host-role eligibility

Other peers only consider a node as a candidate host for model X if
`PeerInfo::routes_http_model` returns true, which requires
`accepts_http_inference()` — `matches!(self.role, NodeRole::Host { .. })`
(`mesh/peer_state.rs`).

`NodeRole::Host { http_port: u16 }` is set in exactly one place in the
whole crate: `startup_handles.rs`, as a side effect of a local model
finishing load. A plugin-only node's role never leaves the default
`Worker`, so **every other peer's `hosts_for_model()` filters this node
out completely**, independent of what its gossip payload advertises.

### 2. Inbound tunnel routing

A request another peer *does* decide to route here arrives as a raw byte
relay: an inbound QUIC stream gets forwarded to a local TCP connection at
`tunnel::Manager`'s configured `http_port`. That port defaults to `0` and
is — like the role above — only ever set as a side effect of a local
model finishing load (`startup_handles.rs`, three call sites). If it's
still `0`, an inbound tunnel is dropped with a warning
(`network/tunnel.rs`).

## Fix

Both gaps have the same shape: a value that should be a property of "the
node's API surface is up," generalized everywhere else in `run_auto()`
since the daemon-lifecycle-reconciliation refactor, but that these two
specific call sites still only set as a side effect of local-model load
completing.

- **Tunnel port**: since `run_auto()` already unconditionally constructs
  `tunnel::Manager` and binds the real API proxy before any model
  resolution happens, set `tunnel_mgr.set_http_port(api_port)`
  immediately after construction, for any node that can serve. The three
  call sites in `startup_handles.rs` remain and become
  redundant-but-harmless (same node, same `api_port`, for the process's
  lifetime) rather than conflicting.
- **Host role**: add `plugin_host_role::spawn`, a small background
  task started alongside the tunnel manager that polls
  `plugin_manager.inference_models()` on a short
  interval and claims `NodeRole::Host { http_port: api_port }` when the
  successful result is non-empty, releasing that claim when it becomes
  empty again. Errors are logged and leave the previous role state intact
  until a successful sample arrives. `mesh::Node` reference-counts local
  model and plugin claims, demotes only after the final claimant releases,
  and re-gossips actual role transitions. The local-model `Exit` fallback
  path also releases its claim explicitly because it bypasses the shared
  shutdown teardown. `inference_models()` reads the plugin manager's own
  already-debounced health state (see `plugin::health`'s startup-grace/
  failure-threshold logic) rather than probing anything itself, so the
  short poll interval doesn't add flapping risk beyond that debouncing.

The tunnel-port fix is a small addition in `run_auto()`'s existing startup
path. The host-role watcher is new (if small) background machinery. Neither
threads through the
passive-listener/model-selection context that an earlier version of this
fix (written against an older fork base, before the
daemon-lifecycle-reconciliation refactor landed upstream) needed and that
would have been dead weight added to an already-dead code path.

## Client nodes

Both changes are gated behind `!is_client`, together, at the same call site:

```rust
if !is_client {
    tunnel_mgr.set_http_port(api_port);
    plugin_host_role::spawn(node.clone(), plugin_manager.clone(), api_port);
}
```

A `--client` node has no compute to offer regardless of plugin state, so the
host-role watcher is pointless there. The tunnel port is gated for a separate
and more important reason: setting it is what makes a node's inbound QUIC HTTP
tunnel terminate at the local API proxy instead of at `tunnel.rs`'s
`port == 0` early-return.

If a client set it, an inbound tunnel from any admitted peer would relay into
the local proxy, find no local model, and route back out to another peer
through `hosts_for_model()` — making the client a mesh-internal request relay.
Nothing would *select* a client that way (clients never advertise `Host`), but
any peer that deliberately dialed one could use it, which on a public mesh
means any member. The OpenAI ingress is inference/discovery-only. The former
`/mesh/load` and `/mesh/drop` paths are rejected with `410 Gone` before model
routing, including when they arrive through an inbound HTTP tunnel, so they
cannot mutate local runtime state or fall through as inference. Local lifecycle
administration uses the trusted management API on `:3131`; remote lifecycle
administration uses the authenticated owner-control plane. Topology-scoped
Skippy stage control remains available on its separate cooperative-inference
transport.

Gating keeps a client exactly as reachable as it was before this change — not
at all — and avoids widening a surface that issue #1190 exists to narrow.
Plugin-only nodes, the case this document is about, are never `--client`, so
the gate does not affect them.

## Deliberately deferred

- **Additional host-role claim sources.** Local model load and plugin health
  now have explicit claims, but future host capabilities may need their own
  claim type and lifecycle. Any new claimant must use the same ownership and
  re-gossip path so it cannot demote a node still serving for another source.
- **Capacity/VRAM-based host ordering.** `order_remote_hosts_by_context`
  and related host-ranking logic (used when multiple peers can serve the
  same model) is built around real local VRAM/context-window numbers. A
  plugin-relayed model has no meaningful local VRAM figure — needs a
  policy decision (advertise an unbounded/synthetic capacity, or exempt
  plugin-sourced models from VRAM-based ranking and use a simpler
  round-robin/health-only ordering among plugin hosts).
- **Model descriptors.** `all_served_model_descriptors` /
  `all_model_runtime_descriptors` assume a real local runtime descriptor
  (loaded quant, context length, etc.). Plugin-sourced models need either
  synthetic descriptors or these call sites need to become Option-aware.
- **Streaming verification through the tunnel path specifically.** Local
  streaming completions through the plugin's proxy are verified working;
  the same request routed to this node over an inbound QUIC tunnel from a
  peer has not been separately verified.
- **Live multi-peer verification.** This fix compiles cleanly and doesn't
  regress the existing single-node acceptance test, but the actual
  mesh-wide behavior it targets — another peer discovering and
  successfully routing a request to a plugin-only node — has not yet been
  exercised by a live multi-peer test.

## History

An earlier version of this branch, written against this fork's original
base (before a large "daemon model lifecycle reconciliation" feature and
related refactors landed on upstream `main`), additionally patched
`network/openai/transport.rs::handle_mesh_request` to merge plugin models
into its own `/v1/models` response and to route matching requests
directly to a plugin's loopback endpoint. That function is reached via
`run_passive`, itself reached only through
`run_auto_model_path_or_shutdown` — a function upstream has since marked
`#[expect(dead_code, reason = "bridges the retained advertised-model and
passive runtime compatibility lanes")]`. The refactor made every node's
own local ingress go through the already-plugin-aware
`network/openai/ingress.rs` path unconditionally instead, which made that
patch a no-op on current `main`. It was reverted once this was confirmed,
rather than landing a fix for an unreachable code path.
