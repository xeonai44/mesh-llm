## Entry workflows

| Workflow | Trigger | Ownership |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pr_quality.yml` (`PR · Quality`) | PR lifecycle | Canonical PR planning plus the protected reusable Quality lane |
| `pr_website.yml` (`PR · Website`) | PR lifecycle | Canonical PR planning plus the protected reusable Website lane |
| `pr_linux.yml` (`PR · Linux`) | PR lifecycle | Canonical PR planning plus the protected reusable Linux lane |
| `pr_macos.yml` (`PR · macOS`) | PR lifecycle | Canonical PR planning plus the protected reusable macOS lane |
| `pr_windows.yml` (`PR · Windows`) | PR lifecycle | Canonical PR planning plus the protected reusable Windows lane |
| `pr-cancel-sibling-runs.yml` (`PR · Cancel sibling lanes`) | protected `workflow_run` on `PR · Quality` entering progress | No-PR-checkout monitor that cancels other exact-revision PR validation lanes after the first definitive job failure |
| `pr_builds.yml` | `workflow_call` only | Inert migration shim for the pre-merge protected runner-contract filename check; no PR event trigger |
| `ci-orchestrator.yml` | `workflow_call` only | Inert migration shim for the pre-merge protected runner-contract filename check; no PR event trigger or lane calls |
| `main_quality.yml` (`Main · Quality`) | push to `main` | Exhaustive main planning plus the same-commit reusable Quality lane |
| `main_website.yml` (`Main · Website`) | push to `main` | Exhaustive main planning plus the same-commit reusable Website lane |
| `main_linux.yml` (`Main · Linux`) | push to `main` | Exhaustive main planning plus the same-commit reusable Linux lane |
| `main_macos.yml` (`Main · macOS`) | push to `main` | Exhaustive main planning plus the same-commit reusable macOS lane |
| `main_windows.yml` (`Main · Windows`) | push to `main` | Exhaustive main planning plus the same-commit reusable Windows lane |
| `ci.yml` | `workflow_call` only | Inert migration shim for the former main ingress filename; no push trigger or dispatch |
| `ci-control.yml` (`CI · Manual Full`) | dispatch on default branch | Explicit operator-only full plan, bounded lane dispatch and correlated diagnostic checks |
| `release.yml` | release tags, dispatch | Canonical version synchronization, release-only signing, assets and publication |
| `website-pages.yml` | main website paths, dispatch | Public website deployment |
| `pr_cleanup.yml` | PR close, dispatch | Positively matched cleanup only |
| `pr_auto_assign.yml` | PR lifecycle | Metadata only |

Other scheduled, deployment, Docker, package, canary and cache-warming
workflows are independent of required PR readiness.

For a non-canary manual dispatch, `release.yml` runs the checked-in
`scripts/release-version.sh`, creates one linear release-source commit when the
tracked version surface changes, and fast-forwards `main` before any release
build starts. `just release` is a preflight and synchronous dispatcher for that
same workflow. A tag-push release is read-only with respect to `main` and is
accepted only when the tag is already reachable from `main` and applying the
same version script produces no tracked diff. Canary dispatches never update
`main` or publish. The publish job creates only the release-specific tag commit
for generated Swift/SDK resources and enables GitHub-generated release notes.
The comparison base is the highest stable `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` tag below the
target; prerelease tags are excluded so RC and final notes use the same stable
baseline.

The five PR lifecycle rows and five main push rows above are the complete
allowed routine validation entry sets. The protected sibling monitor is
metadata/control infrastructure, not a sixth validation entrypoint or required
check. Their separation and direct GitHub log visibility are contractual, not
a presentation preference. `pr_builds.yml`,
`ci-orchestrator.yml`, and `ci.yml` are reusable-only migration scaffolding;
they must never regain event triggers or call the five lanes. They are
removable after this branch's runner contract is active on protected main.

## Reusable workflows and slices

| Workflow | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `ci-quality-lane.yml` | Quality and runner/cache contract graph; reusable from PRs and dispatchable for main/manual |
| `ci-website-lane.yml` | Console and website graph; reusable from PRs and dispatchable for main/manual |
| `ci-linux-lane.yml` | Linux host/runtime/product/Rust/SDK/smoke graph with one platform-local UI producer |
| `ci-macos-lane.yml` | macOS host/runtime/product/platform/Swift/Metal graph with one platform-local UI producer |
| `ci-windows-lane.yml` | Windows host/runtime/product/platform graph with one platform-local UI producer |
| `ci-quality-slice.yml` | Contracts, format, Clippy and CLI/docs guard; additive protected authority sentinel |
| `ci-web-slice.yml` | Console quality, console Playwright E2E, and public website build |
| `ci-ui-artifact-slice.yml` | Immutable console distribution producer |
| `static-abi-artifact.yml` | Typed static llama ABI producer with internal runner policy and an exact toolchain-epoch output |
| `ci-rust-tests-slice.yml` | Typed deterministic Cargo test batches that verify the producer-owned static ABI toolchain epoch |
| `ci-{linux,macos,windows}-host-slice.yml` | Platform-pure neutral host producers; no empty cross-platform jobs |
| `ci-{linux,macos,windows}-runtime-slice.yml` | Platform-pure native runtime producers |
| `ci-{linux,macos,windows}-product-slice.yml` | Platform-pure composition-only product consumers |
| `ci-platform-checks-slice.yml` | macOS portable/unit, Windows portable, and Windows log-store privacy ACL checks |
| `ci-linux-product-smoke-slice.yml`, `ci-macos-product-smoke-slice.yml` | Platform-local CPU, CUDA (`gpu-nvidia` self-hosted), two-node, Metal and model-download consumers; ROCm/Vulkan products remain package-verified pending eligible inference runners |
| `ci-linux-sdk-slice.yml`, `ci-macos-sdk-slice.yml` | Platform-local Rust/Kotlin/Swift smoke consumers; SDK producers are independent top-level calls |
| `ci-runner-contract-slice.yml` | Provider/cache/plan trust and main runner-image checks |
| `native-sdk-artifact.yml` | Typed native SDK producer |
| `swift-sdk-artifact.yml` | Host-only/full XCFramework producer; trusted main remains `macos-15`, while eligible same-repository PRs follow the protected Depot macOS 15 gate |
| `smoke.yml` | Artifact-based inference/OpenAI/split smoke |
| `scripted-binary-smoke.yml` | Artifact-based scripted product smoke |
| `sdk-smoke.yml` | Artifact-based SDK consumers |
| `hf-download-smoke.yml` | Hugging Face download smoke |

All workflow calls use typed, bounded semantic inputs. Credential-bearing smoke
workflows remain fixed to GitHub-hosted runners; the PR entrypoints pass no
repository secrets. The trusted main entrypoint may pass the optional
`HF_TOKEN` for public-fixture rate-limit resilience.

## Planner contract

- `scripts/plan-ci.py` is the only routing implementation.
- `ci/ownership.yml` maps paths and direct crates to semantic domains; unknown
  paths fail closed.
- `ci/slices.yml` defines profiles, slice dependencies, rows, runner roles,
  cache modes and worker budgets.
- `ci/ci-plan.schema.json` versions the machine-readable output.
- `compute-changes` supplies the complete event diff and affected Cargo
  closure; the planner owns signals and final matrix selection.
- Each `pr_*.yml` workflow checks out the default branch for canonical planning,
  projects one bounded lane, and calls its matching default-branch lane as a
  nested reusable workflow. Jobs and logs remain attached to five focused PR
  runs rather than one monolithic graph.
- Each `main_*.yml` workflow plans the exhaustive main profile at the pushed
  SHA, projects one bounded lane, and calls its matching same-commit lane as a
  nested reusable workflow. Routine main jobs and logs therefore remain
  attached to five focused main runs.
- `ci-control.yml` is manual-full only. It calls the planner once and dispatches
  bounded JSON lane projections as native inputs for explicit operator
  diagnostics; it cannot receive a push, PR, or workflow-run event.

Main/manual profiles enumerate every workspace crate exactly once and all
supported product/SDK rows. PR profiles select affected or directly owned rows
from that same catalog.

## Artifact and cache owners

- `prepare-host-input` / `prepare-windows-host-input`: neutral host bytes,
  import report and checksum.
- `prepare-native-runtime-input`: one verified native runtime archive and
  manifest.
- `prepare-static-abi-input`: portable static ABI archive.
- `compose-product-input`: exact host/runtime verification and composition.
- `restore-smoke-inputs`: product/model extraction for consumers.
- `select-ci-runners`: provider labels, cache permissions, and the
  provider-derived `allow_native_github_cache` / `allow_depot_remote_cache`
  outputs. Depot selections disable both cache paths by default. During the
  bounded approved exception, the exact PR revision and eligible trusted-main
  Depot jobs enable the GitHub Actions cache API while direct Depot remote
  cache remains disabled. Hosted PR, release, and cache-warmer selections
  retain native GitHub cache behavior.
- `configure-sccache-gha`: event/provider-derived compiler-cache setup.
- `capture-sccache-stats`: machine-readable cache evidence.

`scripts/collect-ci-metrics.py` is the read-only timing evidence collector. Its
schema-v3 report keeps workflow wall/queue, job runner queue, measured
dependency wait, job execution, runner-minutes, cancelled runner-minutes and
peak workers separate. It groups observations by provider, operating system,
architecture, semantic runner role and Depot size, and emits deterministic
queue/capacity heuristics plus an optional provider-cohort comparison. Raw
inputs and dated reports belong under `/tmp` or a tracking issue/artifact, not
under `ci/` or this inventory.

Artifacts are correctness boundaries; caches only accelerate regeneration.
PR artifacts generally retain for one day. Fork lanes cannot publish shared
trusted-main caches. Same-repository PRs normally use GitHub's ref-scoped cache;
an exact approved revision may temporarily use Depot's shared cross-branch
namespace under `ci/DEPOT_PR_RISK_EXCEPTION.md`. That namespace is treated as
untrusted input, not an authority or correctness boundary. Large Cargo target caches restore trusted-main entries but remain
restore-only on PRs. Exact Linux static ABI, Swift ABI, macOS Metal unit ABI,
and Windows native ABI caches may publish into GitHub's isolated PR merge-ref
scope for same-PR reruns. The Website slice is the sole publisher for the
shared pnpm key and owns the website npm cache; platform UI producers restore
the pnpm store without racing to save it. Trusted main owns shared publication.

PR Rust-test, host, native-runtime, product, and platform-check matrices receive
`fail_fast: true`; main/manual pass `false`. Quality matrices remain
non-fail-fast and failed producers suppress impossible consumers through
`needs`. One protected, default-branch `workflow_run` monitor starts with
`PR · Quality`, polls the five exact-PR/exact-SHA validation runs, preserves the
run containing the first definitive failed job, and cancels its queued or
in-progress siblings. It checks out only the default branch, owns the sole
`actions: write` token for this operation, and never targets main, manual,
release, deployment, cleanup, cache-warming, another PR event epoch, or a newer
revision. PR-controlled workflows and executor jobs retain no Actions-write
permission.

## Providers and variables

GitHub-hosted labels are `ubuntu-24.04`, `ubuntu-24.04-arm`, `macos-15`, and
`windows-2022`. Depot labels are selected only by `select-ci-runners`; no
workflow accepts a raw provider label. Trusted main Linux requires
`DEPOT_RUNNERS_ENABLED=true`. An exact same-repository PR revision may use the
time-bounded exception only when `DEPOT_PR_RUNNERS_ENABLED=true` and both
`DEPOT_PR_APPROVED_REF` and `DEPOT_PR_APPROVED_SHA` match; it expires on
2026-09-14 UTC. Forks remain hosted. The intended permanent gate
may cover eligible build/test rows across Linux, Depot macOS 15 and Windows
2022 when equivalent images/architectures exist; planning/required summaries,
credential-bearing smokes, `gpu-nvidia` hardware and uncertified Intel macOS
rows remain exceptions. The documented `gpu-nvidia` ephemeral scale set is
the sole current uncredentialed, hardware-qualified same-repository PR
exception.

The permanent Depot PR gate is documented in `ci/DEPOT_MIGRATION.md`; the
accepted temporary findings and risks are in
`ci/DEPOT_PR_RISK_EXCEPTION.md`. Permanent activation requires cache
isolation, no PR cache/registry tokens, exact protected workflow refs,
ephemeral runners, a successful sentinel, and a tested GitHub rollback.

External administrative posture is now verified as follows: automatic Depot
Cache connectivity is disabled, automatic Registry Actions authentication is
disabled, and the Depot runner group is restricted to `Mesh-LLM/mesh-llm` and
the exact protected workflow refs. The repository token cannot independently
inspect organization runner-group settings through the API (403), so these
remain external facts rather than checked-in evidence. The two switches remove
Depot's direct `DEPOT_CACHE_TOKEN`/WebDAV build-tool preconfiguration and
Registry Actions authentication on fresh runners; they do not document or
enforce a per-connection/job/ref disable or ACL for the GitHub Actions cache
proxy/runtime-token path. The controlled
trusted-main seed [run 31816775585](https://github.com/Mesh-LLM/mesh-llm/actions/runs/31816775585)
succeeded at `main` commit `9e977e246`; the same-repository PR authority
sentinel [run 31816869128 / job 94821057215](https://github.com/Mesh-LLM/mesh-llm/actions/runs/31816869128/job/94821057215)
read and exactly validated the trusted seed, saved/cleared/restored and
exactly validated the poison, then failed its intended seed-isolation gate;
the enclosing PR run was later cancelled during cleanup. Trusted-main verify
[run 31817111471 / job 94821343605](https://github.com/Mesh-LLM/mesh-llm/actions/runs/31817111471/job/94821343605)
restored and exactly validated that poison, then failed its intended expected-
miss gate. This proves unsafe repository-scoped cross-trust authority, so it is
not a successful isolation result. The bounded exception knowingly accepts
that risk for exact ref/SHA-approved same-repository revisions to gain CI
iteration speed; it is not permanent-isolation evidence. The exact-SHA
five-lane candidate, provider comparison, and identical-SHA hosted rollback
are recorded in `.omo/specs/depot-pr-rollout-evidence.md`; Quality and Linux
had favorable queue observations but remain unclassified because execution
was cache-confounded, Website had insufficient samples, and macOS/Windows hit
the capacity rollback threshold. Fork PR validation and namespace purge/expiry
confirmation remain pending. Fork PR validation remains hosted and is the
no-Depot-authority half of the sentinel acceptance evidence; only the exact
same-repository sentinel ref may exercise the diagnostic Depot job. All three
sentinel cache phases attest the
provider-injected `ACTIONS_CACHE_URL`/`ACTIONS_RESULTS_URL` structure before
invoking pinned `actions/cache` restore/save actions. The shell attestation
does not require ambient `ACTIONS_RUNTIME_TOKEN`: GitHub's
`NodeScriptActionHandler` injects that credential into the cache actions, while
the shell `ScriptHandler` does not. Successful full restore/save is the
credential/token proof. The non-loopback check includes all IPv4 `127/8`
and IPv4-mapped IPv6 loopback spellings.
The protected PR probe clears and fully restores its saved poison key, requires
a cache hit and exact marker bytes before the trusted-seed gate, and thereby
proves the same-job Node token/write path; main verify's poison miss remains
the cross-scope proof.

The provider contract required before permanent PR placement is enabled is a documented,
server-enforced per-connection/job/ref control for the GitHub Actions cache
path. It must either leave PR jobs on GitHub-native branch-scoped
`ACTIONS_CACHE_URL`/`ACTIONS_RESULTS_URL` and runtime-token semantics with no
Depot proxy or direct cache token, or issue a PR-isolated namespace/token whose
ACL permits reads and writes only within that PR, denying reads and writes from
trusted main/release and every other PR namespace, without exposing
`DEPOT_CACHE_TOKEN`.
Key prefixes, loopback proxies,
ephemeral runners and the org switches are not equivalent controls. A fresh
same-repository PR, fork PR and trusted-main seed/verify sentinel must prove
the selected behavior before the temporary exception is removed.
Bracketed IPv6 authorities use the fixed runner's Python 3.8+ stdlib
`ipaddress` classifier; parser absence/version/invalidity fails closed.
Attestation reports only value-free variable/reason classes and fails closed
on malformed or missing backend data.

Relevant repository variable names include `DEPOT_RUNNERS_ENABLED`,
`DEPOT_PR_RUNNERS_ENABLED` (global temporary exception gate),
`DEPOT_PR_APPROVED_REF` (one exact merge ref), `DEPOT_PR_APPROVED_SHA` (the
exact lowercase PR head SHA; refresh after every push),
`DEPOT_PR_CANARY_REF` (absent by default; one exact
`refs/pull/<number>/merge` ref only), `DEPOT_PR_SENTINEL_REF` (absent by
default; one exact same-repository merge ref used only by the protected
no-checkout authority diagnostic), and `DEPOT_PR_SENTINEL_ID` (absent by
default; exactly 32 lowercase hexadecimal characters when the diagnostic is
deliberately armed). The canary and sentinel variables are bounded selectors,
not cache-isolation proofs or replacements for the global PR gate. The normal
Quality runner policy continues to use `DEPOT_PR_CANARY_REF`; the sentinel
uses a separate selector output and cannot move the normal build jobs.
The eligible five-lane Depot graph disables every native GitHub cache consumer
when `allow_native_github_cache=false`. During the bounded exception the exact
approved PR and eligible trusted-main Depot jobs set that output true for
cross-branch Depot Actions-cache reuse; direct Depot remote cache remains
false. This checked-in mode does not
prove the absence of ambient Depot/WebDAV authority, so the runtime sentinel
has recorded unsafe repository-scoped cross-trust authority and must be
redesigned and repeated successfully; no-secret/no-token, fork and provider-
parity canaries remain required. Other variables include `CUDA_VERSION`,
`VULKAN_SDK_VERSION`, smoke configuration variables, and release/deployment
variables. Secret values never belong in this inventory;
known names include `HF_TOKEN`, release-attestation keys, `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN`
and deployment tokens.

## Live inspection

Use read-only commands when live state matters:

```bash
gh workflow list --all --repo Mesh-LLM/mesh-llm
gh run list --repo Mesh-LLM/mesh-llm --limit 30
gh variable list --repo Mesh-LLM/mesh-llm
gh api repos/Mesh-LLM/mesh-llm/rulesets
gh api orgs/Mesh-LLM/actions/runner-groups
```

Organization runner-group responses of `403` are unverified administrative
state, not proof that a restriction is absent.
