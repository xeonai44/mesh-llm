# deploy-macos

Use this when standing up mesh-llm on a macOS machine — either installing a
release or shipping a locally built dev binary to a remote Mac for testing.

This is the macOS counterpart to `deploy-linux-gpu`. The current binary embeds
the staged llama.cpp runtime: the bundle is a **single `mesh-llm` binary**.
There is no `rpc-server`, no `llama-server`, and no `.dylib` set anymore — if
you see instructions mentioning those, they are outdated.

Related skills/docs:

- `deploy-linux-gpu` — remote Linux/CUDA nodes
- `deploy-windows` — Windows nodes
- `mesh-join` — creating/joining private and public meshes (tokens, NAT, multi-node)
- `connect-agents` — pointing Goose/Claude Code/OpenCode/Pi at a running mesh
- `docs/USAGE.md` — install details, service mode, model storage
- `docs/CLI.md` — full command and model-ref reference

## The one rule that matters most

**mesh-llm resolves and downloads the model itself.** Pass `--model <ref>` and
it fetches the GGUF into the standard Hugging Face cache on first use. Do NOT
pre-download with `hf`/`huggingface-cli`, do NOT scp GGUFs around. (Only
`--gguf` takes a local file path you manage yourself.)

## Install path A: official release (most cases)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mesh-LLM/mesh-llm/main/install.sh | bash
```

The binary lands at `~/.local/bin/mesh-llm` (may not be on a non-interactive
SSH `PATH` — use the full path or `bash -lc`). Metal is the macOS backend; the
installer picks it automatically.

To install as a per-user background service (launchd agent) in the same step:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mesh-LLM/mesh-llm/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --service
```

Service files: `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.mesh-llm.mesh-llm.plist`, shared env
in `~/.config/mesh-llm/service.env`, startup models in `~/.mesh-llm/config.toml`.

## Install path B: dev build to a remote Mac

Build and bundle locally (from the repo):

```bash
just release-build   # serious testing must use the release binary
just bundle          # /tmp/mesh-llm-bundle.tar.gz (single mesh-llm binary)
```

Ship and unpack:

```bash
scp -P <SSH_PORT> /tmp/mesh-llm-bundle.tar.gz user@host:
ssh -p <SSH_PORT> user@host 'mkdir -p ~/bin && tar xzf mesh-llm-bundle.tar.gz -C ~/bin --strip-components=1'
```

### Fix macOS quarantine — ALWAYS after scp

Files transferred via scp get provenance/quarantine xattrs that make macOS
SIGKILL the binary on launch (exit 137). After every scp:

```bash
codesign -s - ~/bin/mesh-llm
xattr -cr ~/bin/mesh-llm
```

Verify: `xattr ~/bin/mesh-llm` should print nothing. Note codesign changes the
file hash — don't compare local vs remote hashes after signing.

Verify the version on the remote matches what you built:

```bash
~/bin/mesh-llm --version
```

## Launch

Serve a model and join the public mesh:

```bash
mesh-llm serve --model unsloth/Qwen3.6-27B-GGUF:UD-Q4_K_XL --auto
```

- `--auto` discovers and joins the community mesh; local serving and mesh
  joining happen together.
- Without `--auto` (and without `--join`/`--discover`) you create a private
  mesh and an invite token is emitted — see the `mesh-join` skill.
- `--model` accepts catalog names, `repo:QUANT`, `repo/file.gguf`, or a full HF
  URL. `--gguf /path/file.gguf` serves a local file directly.
- API on `:9337`, management console on `:3131` (override with `--port` /
  `--console`).

Notes / gotchas:

- **Do NOT use `--headless` to "go quiet"** — it only disables the embedded web
  UI and does nothing for backgrounding. For machine-readable output use
  `--log-format json`.
- **Model load takes time.** Poll `/v1/models` until your model appears before
  concluding anything is broken.
- For background test runs from an agent:
  `bash -c 'nohup mesh-llm serve --model <ref> --auto > /tmp/mesh.log 2>&1 & disown'`.
  For persistence across reboots, prefer the `--service` install.

## Verify it's actually serving

```bash
# Ports bound
lsof -nP -iTCP:9337 -iTCP:3131 -sTCP:LISTEN

# Models (union of local + mesh peers)
curl -s http://localhost:9337/v1/models | python3 -m json.tool

# Status / peers
curl -s http://localhost:3131/api/status | python3 -m json.tool

# Inference — the returned "model" field tells you which node/model answered
curl -s http://localhost:9337/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"auto","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hi"}],"max_tokens":16}'
```

To force your local model specifically, pass its exact id from `/v1/models`
instead of `auto`.

## Logs and state

- `~/.mesh-llm/runtime/<pid>/logs/skippy-native.log` — embedded llama.cpp/skippy
  native logs. Check here first if a model fails to load.
- `~/.mesh-llm/key` — persistent node identity.
- `~/.mesh-llm/config.toml` — startup models and defaults for bare `mesh-llm serve`.
- HF cache (`~/.cache/huggingface/...`) — downloaded GGUFs; you generally never
  need to touch this.

## Stop / clean up

```bash
mesh-llm stop        # scoped stop of tracked instances (preferred)
# emergency only: use the PID for the specific instance being validated
kill -9 <mesh-llm-pid>
```

A clean stop removes the instance runtime dir under `~/.mesh-llm/runtime/`.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Exit 137 immediately after scp | macOS quarantine/provenance xattr | `codesign -s - <bin>; xattr -cr <dir>` |
| `mesh-llm: command not found` over SSH | `~/.local/bin` not on non-interactive PATH | Full path or `bash -lc` |
| Empty `/v1/models` | Model still downloading/loading | Wait; watch skippy-native.log |
| "No inference server available" | Election in progress or load failed | Check stderr + skippy-native.log |
| Stale runtime dir after crash | Unclean exit | `rm -rf ~/.mesh-llm/runtime/<stale_pid>/` (auto-GC'd after 1h too) |
