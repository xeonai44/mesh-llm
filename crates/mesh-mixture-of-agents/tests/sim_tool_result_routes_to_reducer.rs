//! Pin the tool-result turn classification.
//!
//! Background — PR #566 review feedback (Apr 2026):
//!
//! > The tool-result path isn't ready for agent loops:
//! > - A tool-result follow-up was treated like another fanout turn.
//! > - It wasn't handled like a controlled reducer/synthesis turn.
//! > - Tool results should be handled carefully and predictably, not
//! >   sprayed back through the whole fanout path.
//!
//! When the conversation has a recent tool result that has not yet
//! been synthesized into an assistant answer, the gateway must take
//! the reducer-only path (`TurnKind::ToolResult`), not fan-out to all
//! workers. Fanning out wastes a round-trip per worker, drowns the
//! reducer in worker outputs that ignore the tool result, and \u2014 most
//! dangerously \u2014 invites a worker to re-propose the same tool call
//! whose result we already have in-context.
//!
//! Two shapes of agent conversation must classify as ToolResult:
//!
//! 1. **OpenAI canonical shape.** The last message has role `tool`
//!    (the harness sent the tool result and expects the next assistant
//!    turn to interpret it). This is the simplest and most explicit
//!    shape. Classifying this is straightforward.
//!
//! 2. **Trailing-user shape.** The conversation ends with assistant
//!    tool_calls + tool result + a user message that just nudges
//!    ("continue", "what did you find?"). The harness has left the
//!    tool result in-context for the model to consume. There is no
//!    new tool result in *this* turn, but the previous one was never
//!    synthesized into an assistant message. Today this classifies
//!    as `Continuation` and fans out \u2014 wrong per the review.
//!
//! This file pins both shapes.
