//! Pin the worker-accounting contract for `TurnResult.worker_summaries`.
//!
//! Background — PR #566 review feedback (Apr 2026):
//!
//! > Worker accounting was inconsistent:
//! > - Similar requests reported different `x-moa-workers` values.
//! > - Similar requests reported different `x-moa-workers-ok` values.
//! > - Some successful responses used fewer workers than expected.
//! > - Some churn responses still appeared to report stale worker counts.
//! > - One concurrency response reported zero successful workers.
//!
//! `worker_summaries.len()` is what the `x-moa-workers` header reports.
//! If the gateway dispatches N workers, the summaries must reflect all
//! N of them once the turn finishes — including ones that were aborted
//! by early-exit consensus. Otherwise a client cannot tell whether the
//! response came from 2 workers because we only dispatched 2 or because
//! 2 more were cancelled mid-flight.
//!
//! Two regressions this file pins:
//!
//! 1. **Early-exit aborts must still be accounted for.** When the
//!    arbiter decides from the first two workers and aborts the rest,
//!    the cancelled workers' summaries are silently dropped today
//!    because `gather_workers_incremental` drains `join_next()` with
//!    `if let Ok(...)` and `JoinSet::abort_all` returns
//!    `Err(JoinError::cancelled)` for the aborted tasks.
//!
//! 2. **All-fail must still attribute every worker.** When every
//!    backend errors, `worker_summaries.len()` must still equal the
//!    number of workers dispatched. (This one passes today because the
//!    `Err` branch in `gather_workers_incremental` pushes a summary
//!    regardless — `sim_all_workers_fail.rs` already covers it.)
