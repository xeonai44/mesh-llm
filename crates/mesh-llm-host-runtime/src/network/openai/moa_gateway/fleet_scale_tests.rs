//! Thousand-scale robustness for MoA pool assembly.
//!
//! `fleet_sim_tests.rs` measures admitted *width*; `fleet_fairness_tests.rs`
//! measures how scarce big-tier capacity is *shared*. This file measures what
//! happens when the fleet is large and things go wrong:
//!
//! - Assembly is on the **per-request** path (`assemble_worker_pool` runs for
//!   every `model=mesh` turn), and it walks every peer at least twice
//!   (`models_being_served`, `gossiped_sizes`, `model_routing_hints`). So its
//!   cost in fleet size is a serving property, not a test curiosity.
//! - Degradation shapes: every peer paused, every peer deprioritized, a fleet
//!   with no big tier, and a fleet where the only big replicas are unreachable.
//!
//! These are measurements plus a small number of load-bearing assertions. The
//! timings are wall-clock on one machine and are recorded for *shape* (linear
//! vs superlinear), not as a performance budget — a threshold assertion here
//! would be flaky on CI hardware.
