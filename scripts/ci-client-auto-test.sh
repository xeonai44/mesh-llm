#!/usr/bin/env bash
# ci-client-auto-test.sh — verify `mesh-llm client --auto` boots its API
# AND actually joins the public mesh.
#
# Two invariants:
#   1. Even when Nostr discovery returns dead/stale peers, the management API
#      on :3132 must come up. A broken implementation thrashes retrying dead
#      peers and never binds the console port.
#   2. With public Nostr discovery available, the node must actually join a
#      mesh — i.e. /api/status reports mesh_id set AND (peers non-empty OR
#      first_joined_mesh_ts set). This catches regressions where discovery,
#      gossip, or join-handshake silently break and the node sits idle.
#
# Usage: scripts/ci-client-auto-test.sh <mesh-llm-binary>
#
# Exits 0 only if both invariants hold; 1 otherwise.
