# llama-upstream canary agent repair (issue #1434; wired into
# llama-upstream-canary.yml for both patch-queue apply failures and family
# battery failures).
#
# Usage: llama-canary-agent-repair.sh <mode> [upstream-sha]
#   mode: patch-queue  - prepare-llama.sh failed to apply the patch queue
#                        onto the new upstream; the agent rebases the queue.
#   mode: battery      - the patch queue applied but the family battery
#                        failed; the agent fixes the root cause.
#   upstream-sha: 40-hex llama.cpp commit, preferentially passed via the
#                  UPSTREAM_SHA_INPUT environment variable (callers must
#                  never interpolate untrusted dispatch values into shell).
#                  When omitted, resolves master via git ls-remote. "latest"
#                  is also accepted. Battery-mode evidence: when the workflow
#                  tees its battery log to $BATTERY_LOG, it is reused instead
#                  of re-running the battery before the first repair turn.
#
# Drives a non-interactive `opencode` agent (model:
# zai-coding-plan/glm-5.3-flash by default) to repair, then the wrapper
# itself re-runs the certification battery. If it fails, each failure gets
# its own opencode repair turn (with the battery failure summary in the
# prompt) followed by a recertify, up to CANARY_REPAIR_MAX_TURNS (default 2)
# repair turns. The script only succeeds when the battery actually passes
# on this runner.
#
# PR guarantee: whatever the outcome, the wrapper (not the agent) ensures a
# repair PR exists on $BRANCH and posts a status comment describing the work
# done and, on failure, what the agent is stuck on and needs human help
# with. The PR description is written by an agent turn that runs BEFORE
# certification (upstream changes, patch-queue evolution, risks) with a
# deterministic fallback body. After a GREEN battery exactly one more agent
# turn runs: a fresh-context review of the certified repair that may modify
# the tree (dropped patch intent, rebase leftovers, ABI mirror drift); its
# changes ride as a separate review(llama): commit and are flagged in the
# success comment. That review is fail-open and never blocks a green repair.
#
# Credential split: the agent never sees a GitHub token — CANARY_REPAIR_TOKEN
# is stripped from its environment, and only the deterministic wrapper
# performs git pushes, PR creation, PR edits, and comments with the token
# scoped to individual commands. The wrapper — never the agent — commits the
# certified tree, pushes it, and verifies the repair PR head equals the
# certified commit before reporting success.
#
# Credentials: pushes/PRs use $CANARY_REPAIR_TOKEN (fine-grained PAT with
# Contents+PR write; the canary job itself stays contents: read). The agent
# needs OPENCODE_API_KEY/NEMOTRON_API_KEY or an `opencode auth login`
# profile on the runner.

Review the repair, not the upstream code. Certification parity cannot see semantic losses, so check:
1. Dropped intent: does any conflict resolution or regenerated patch silently stop doing what the old patch did (a deliberately-kept upstream feature accidentally deleted, a guard or accounting change quietly dropped)?
2. Rebase leftovers: conflict markers, duplicate patch fragments, hunks that now apply as no-ops, stale patch descriptions.
3. Patch hygiene: series ordering, patch subjects/bodies still matching content, no accidental upstream-code deletion (per the skills, patches must not delete upstream behavior we are not chartered to delete).
4. ABI mirrors: if any patch changed the stage ABI, did the Rust mirrors in crates/ track it (version + PREPARE_SCHEMA bumped together)?
5. Weakened lanes: any manifest, policy, or battery change that certifies less than before?

If (and only if) you find a real defect, fix it minimally in the patch queue (or its Rust ABI mirror) and commit locally with message "review(llama): <what and why>".
