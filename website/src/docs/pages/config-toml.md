# Config File

mesh-llm reads configuration from `~/.mesh-llm/config.toml` by default. You can override the path with the `MESH_LLM_CONFIG` environment variable.

The file uses standard [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) syntax. Config is validated when loaded and on save; invalid files produce a clear error at startup.

## Version

```toml
version = 1
```

Must be `1`. This is the only supported schema version. Future schema changes will bump this field for backward compatibility.

## GPU

Controls GPU assignment and parallelism.

```toml
[gpu]
assignment = "auto"       # "auto" (default) or "pinned"
parallel  = 2              # Optional total parallel inference slots
```

- `assignment` — `"auto"` lets mesh-llm assign GPUs dynamically; `"pinned"` locks models to specific GPUs.
- `parallel` — optional total parallel inference-slot count. Omit it to let the runtime choose.

## Owner Control

Network identity and binding.

```toml
[owner_control]
bind           = "[::]:7447"   # Mesh owner-control listen address
advertise_addr = ""             # Override the address advertised to peers
```

- `bind` — address and port for the owner-control endpoint. The inference API remains on `9337` unless changed by the runtime surface.
- `advertise_addr` — address and port announced to peers. Auto-detected when empty; set it explicitly for NAT or Docker setups.

## Telemetry

OpenTelemetry (OTLP) metrics export.

```toml
[telemetry]
enabled            = false                  # Enable OTLP metrics export
service_name       = "mesh-llm"             # OTLP service.name attribute
endpoint           = "http://localhost:4318" # OTLP HTTP endpoint
headers            = {}                     # Extra headers sent with OTLP requests
export_interval_secs = 10                   # Metrics export interval
queue_size         = 2048                   # Metrics queue capacity

[telemetry.metrics]
endpoint = "http://localhost:4318"           # Override endpoint for metrics (optional)
```

The `[telemetry.metrics]` sub-section is optional — it overrides the top-level endpoint specifically for metric signals.

## Mesh Requirements

Peer compatibility constraints.

```toml
[mesh_requirements]
# Optional node/release bounds. Omit these unless the mesh needs an admission gate.
# min_node_version         = "0.72.0"
# max_node_version         = "0.72.1"
min_protocol_version      = 0    # Minimum acceptable peer protocol version
max_protocol_version      = 0    # Maximum acceptable peer protocol version
require_release_attestation = false
release_signer_keys       = []   # Allowed release signer public keys
```

- `min_node_version` / `max_node_version` — optional semantic-version bounds for peers.
- `min_protocol_version` / `max_protocol_version` — constrain peer protocol versions. `0` means no constraint.
- `release_signer_keys` — if set, only accept peers whose release binary is signed by one of these keys.

## Runtime

Runtime mode, startup behavior, draining, activity-aware admission, and model
reconciliation.

```toml
[runtime]
mode = "serve"
startup_failure_policy = "best_effort"
drain_timeout_secs = 30
drain_timeout_max_secs = 300
reconcile_model_targets                = false
reconcile_model_target_demand_upgrades = false
model_target_demand_upgrade_min_requests = 2
model_target_demand_upgrade_max_age_secs = 3600

[runtime.activity]
enabled = false
idle_after_secs = 300
poll_interval_secs = 5
resume_debounce_secs = 30
response = "pause_remote"
advertisement = "coarse_state"
```

| Mode | Configured models | Explicit CLI models | Local loads |
|---|---|---|---|
| `serve` (default) | Eager | Eager | Allowed |
| `on_demand` | Candidate metadata; not eager | Eager | Allowed |
| `client` | Never loaded locally | Conflicts | Disabled |

`startup_failure_policy` accepts `best_effort` (default, keep the daemon
running) or `fail_fast` (abort when an eager model fails).
`drain_timeout_secs` and `drain_timeout_max_secs` must each be from 1 to 3600,
and the normal timeout cannot exceed the maximum.

Activity adaptation is opt-in. `idle_after_secs` is 30–86400,
`poll_interval_secs` is 1–60, and `resume_debounce_secs` is 0–300. `response`
accepts `pause_remote`, `pause_all`, or `reduce_priority`. `advertisement`
accepts `none`, `availability_only`, `coarse_state`, or
`private_coarse_state`. Manual activity overrides are session-only and are not
written to this file.

Model target reconciliation keeps running models aligned with configured
targets. Demand upgrades use the minimum request count and maximum request age
above when deciding whether a higher-quality target is warranted. See
[Runtime Lifecycle](/docs/pages/runtime-lifecycle/) for the complete behavior,
security, and status model.
