# Installing on Linux

Install Mesh on every Linux machine that should serve a model or call into a mesh.

## Quick install

```sh
curl -fsSL https://meshllm.cloud/install.sh | bash
```

Open a new terminal after install if the installer added Mesh to your `PATH`.

Check the install:

```sh
mesh-llm --version
```

### Minimal Linux images

The Linux native runtime uses the GNU OpenMP runtime. On minimal Debian or
Ubuntu images, install `libgomp1` before running Mesh:

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libgomp1
```

When building a container image, the build usually runs as `root`, so use the
equivalent Dockerfile form without `sudo` and clean up the apt lists:

```Dockerfile
RUN apt-get update \
 && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends libgomp1 \
 && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

This is especially important for `nvidia/cuda:*runtime` images, which commonly
omit `libgomp1`. The maintained Mesh OCI images already include this package.

## Native packages and containers

Versioned Ubuntu 24.04 `.deb` and Arch Linux `.pkg.tar.zst` files are published
as [Mesh packaging release assets](https://github.com/Mesh-LLM/mesh-packaging/releases).
Choose the file whose distro, architecture, and backend suffix matches the host.
These are directly downloadable release assets, not apt or pacman repositories;
download the package's matching `.sha256` sidecar and verify it before installing
with `apt install` or `pacman -U`.

For Ubuntu, replace the placeholders with the version, architecture, and backend
from the selected release asset. Architecture is `amd64` or `arm64`; copy the
exact backend suffix, such as `cpu`, `vulkan`, or `cuda12.9.2`, from the release:

```sh
PACKAGE='mesh-llm-<version>-ubuntu-<architecture>-<backend>.deb'
RELEASE_URL='https://github.com/Mesh-LLM/mesh-packaging/releases/download/packaging-v<version>'
curl -fLO "$RELEASE_URL/$PACKAGE"
curl -fLO "$RELEASE_URL/$PACKAGE.sha256"
sha256sum --check "$PACKAGE.sha256"
sudo apt install "./$PACKAGE"
```

For Arch Linux, use the matching `amd64` package and backend suffix:

```sh
PACKAGE='mesh-llm-<version>-arch-amd64-<backend>.pkg.tar.zst'
RELEASE_URL='https://github.com/Mesh-LLM/mesh-packaging/releases/download/packaging-v<version>'
curl -fLO "$RELEASE_URL/$PACKAGE"
curl -fLO "$RELEASE_URL/$PACKAGE.sha256"
sha256sum --check "$PACKAGE.sha256"
sudo pacman -U "./$PACKAGE"
```

The same CPU, Vulkan, CUDA, and ROCm package variants are available as OCI
images from [`ghcr.io/mesh-llm/mesh-llm`](https://github.com/orgs/Mesh-LLM/packages/container/package/mesh-llm).
Immutable tags include the Mesh version, distro, architecture, and backend. See
the [packaging matrix](https://github.com/Mesh-LLM/mesh-packaging/blob/main/docs/matrix.md)
for the supported rows and exact tag scheme.

Alpine packages are not published because Mesh release archives currently use
glibc rather than musl.

## What the installer does

The installer downloads the `mesh-llm` executable and adds `~/.local/bin` to your user `PATH` when needed. After install, run `mesh-llm setup` to finish runtime configuration and, if you want it, the background service.

`mesh-llm serve` is a foreground process attached to the current terminal.
When setup installs the optional background service, the systemd user service
owns the same logical runtime's startup, restart, and logs. Do not start a
second foreground copy on the same ports; stop or disable the setup-managed
unit before switching to foreground operation.

## Next step

Run `mesh-llm setup` to finish machine setup. See the [CLI guide](/docs/pages/CLI/) for the setup flags.

## Uninstall

```sh
mesh-llm uninstall --dry-run
mesh-llm uninstall --yes
```

On Linux, uninstall disables the per-user systemd unit when present, removes
setup-owned service files, removes the native-runtime cache, and removes the
executable last. It preserves `~/.mesh-llm` unless you pass `--purge-config`.

## Advanced install

Install the latest prerelease:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://meshllm.cloud/install.sh | bash -s -- --pre-release
```

Install to a custom location:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://meshllm.cloud/install.sh | bash -s -- --install-dir "$HOME/bin"
```
