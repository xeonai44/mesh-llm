# Installing Mesh

Mesh runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows. Choose your platform for detailed install instructions.

The shell and PowerShell installers below remain the simplest installation
path. Versioned Homebrew formulas, Linux native packages, checksums, SBOMs, and
OCI images are published by the public
[`Mesh-LLM/mesh-packaging`](https://github.com/Mesh-LLM/mesh-packaging)
repository. Homebrew formulas are published through the canonical
[`Mesh-LLM/tap`](https://github.com/Mesh-LLM/homebrew-tap) tap, while Linux
packages are release assets rather than apt or pacman repositories.

## Choose your platform

- [Installing on macOS](/docs/pages/installing-macos/) (Apple Silicon, Homebrew)
- [Installing on Linux](/docs/pages/installing-linux/) (platform details)
- [Installing on Windows](/docs/pages/installing-windows/) (platform details)

## What the installer does

The installer downloads the `mesh-llm` executable and adds the install directory to your user `PATH` when needed. After install, run `mesh-llm setup` to finish runtime configuration and service setup.

Default install locations:

| Platform | Default location |
|---|---|
| macOS/Linux | `~/.local/bin` |
| Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\mesh-llm\bin` |

## Verify the install

```sh
mesh-llm --version
```

## Next step

Run `mesh-llm setup` to finish machine setup, then follow the [Quickstart](/docs/pages/quickstart/) to start a private node and open the console.

## Uninstall

Preview what Mesh would remove:

```sh
mesh-llm uninstall --dry-run
```

Remove the executable, setup-owned service files, and native-runtime cache:

```sh
mesh-llm uninstall --yes
```

Uninstall preserves `~/.mesh-llm` configuration and identity data by default.
Use `--purge-config` only when you intentionally want to remove that data too.
